# Unitree Simulation Project

This repository is a skeleton framework for building a Unitree + MuJoCo simulation,
with modular organization of simulation, control, RL, etc.

## Project Structure

- `sim/` — Simulation / environment modules  
- `controllers/` — PID, MPC, control logic  
- `agents/` — RL algorithm implementations  
- `utils/` — Utility modules (logging, config, helpers)  
- `tests/` — Unit tests, validations  

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository  
2. Create environment / install dependencies  
3. Run minimal simulation script  
4. Develop control or learning modules
